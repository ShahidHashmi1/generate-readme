## Description
This project is used to dynamically create README.md files through the command line using node.js. To invoke this CLI-app, navigate to the root directory of this project in terminal, and enter the command:
```ruby
node index.js
```
The goal was ultimately to create an easy-to-use template to generate readme files quickly, and efficiently. This project can be expanded on in the future to include different node packages that are specific to certain types of projects. The final product will be generated and input into the 'dist' folder.
